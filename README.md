## Introduction
With the growing number of songs available online, it becomes difficult for users to find music that matches their tastes. This music recommendation system is designed to make personalized song suggestions using a dataset of user listening history and song features.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yGeekKwame/music-recommendation-system.git
    cd music-recommendation-system
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed to run the project:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```

## Project Structure

```
│   └── Music_Recommendation_System.ipynb  # Main notebook for recommendation system
├── README.md                       # Project documentation
```

## Usage

1. Open the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/Music_Recommendation_System.ipynb
    ```

2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to load the dataset, train the model, and generate music recommendations.

3. Customize the model's parameters and dataset if needed for better recommendations.

## Model Description

The system uses a combination of techniques, such as:

- Collaborative Filtering: Based on user-item interactions to suggest songs similar to those preferred by other users with similar taste.
- Content-Based Filtering: Recommends songs that share similar characteristics with those the user has previously liked.
- Hybrid Approach: A combination of both collaborative and content-based filtering to enhance the quality of recommendations.
